--- thinking_analysis_prompt ---
The user's original request: {original_task}

Analyze the full context and provide your reasoning for the next step. Keep the user's complete original request in mind — if it has multiple parts, ensure you are working toward ALL parts, not just the first.

IMPORTANT: If your next step involves reading or searching multiple files to understand code structure, architecture, or patterns, you MUST delegate to Code-Explorer rather than doing it yourself. Only use direct read_file/search for known, specific targets (1-2 files).

--- thinking_analysis_prompt_with_todos ---
The user's original request: {original_task}

Current todos ({done_count}/{total_count} done):
{todo_status}

Analyze the context and provide your reasoning for the next step. You MUST continue working on the next incomplete todo. Do not summarize or finish until all todos are done.

IMPORTANT: If your next step involves reading or searching multiple files to understand code structure, architecture, or patterns, you MUST delegate to Code-Explorer rather than doing it yourself. Only use direct read_file/search for known, specific targets (1-2 files).

--- thinking_trace_reminder ---
<thinking_trace>
{thinking_trace}
</thinking_trace>

You MUST follow the action plan in your thinking trace above. Execute exactly the next step it describes — do not skip ahead or choose a different approach.

--- subagent_complete_signal ---
<subagent_complete>
All subagents have completed. Evaluate ALL results together and continue:
1. If the user asked a question, synthesize findings from all agents into one unified answer — do not summarize each agent separately.
2. If the user requested implementation, proceed — write code, edit files, run commands.
3. If the subagent failed or found nothing useful, handle the task directly. Do NOT re-spawn the same subagent.
</subagent_complete>

--- planner_complete_signal ---
<planner_complete>
The Planner has finished writing the plan. You MUST now call present_plan(plan_file_path="{plan_file_path}") to show it to the user for approval. Do NOT start implementing or reading files — the user must approve the plan first.
</planner_complete>

--- failed_tool_nudge ---
The previous operation failed. Please fix the issue and try again, or call task_complete with status='failed' if you cannot proceed.

--- nudge_permission_error ---
The operation failed due to a file permission error. Check if the file is read-only or owned by another user. Try a different path or use run_command with appropriate permissions.

--- nudge_file_not_found ---
The file was not found. Use list_files or search to locate the correct path before retrying.

--- nudge_syntax_error ---
The edit resulted in a syntax error. Read the file again to see its current state, then retry with corrected content.

--- nudge_rate_limit ---
The API rate limit was hit. Wait a moment before retrying. Consider reducing concurrent operations.

--- nudge_timeout ---
The command timed out. Try a more targeted approach (e.g., search specific directories instead of the entire repo).

--- nudge_edit_mismatch ---
The edit_file old_content did not match. The file may have changed. Read the file again to get the exact current content, then retry.

--- consecutive_reads_nudge ---
You have been reading without taking action. If you have enough information, proceed with implementation. If you need clarification, ask the user.

--- safety_limit_summary ---
Please provide a summary of what you've found and what needs to be done.

--- thinking_on_instruction ---
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - THINKING MODE IS ON:** You MUST call the `think` tool FIRST before calling ANY other tool. This is mandatory - do NOT skip this step. Do NOT call write_file, read_file, bash, or any other tool before calling `think`. In your thinking, explain step-by-step: what you understand about the task, your approach, and your planned actions. Aim for 100-300 words. Only after calling `think` may you proceed with other tools.

--- thinking_off_instruction ---
For complex tasks, briefly explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences. For simple tasks, act directly.

--- incomplete_todos_nudge ---
STOP — you have {count} incomplete todo(s):
{todo_list}

You MUST NOT finish. Continue working on the next incomplete todo immediately. Only call task_complete after ALL todos are done.

--- file_read_nudge ---
You have made {consecutive_reads} consecutive read-only operations without taking action.

Consider:
1. If you have enough information, proceed with the task
2. If you need clarification, ask the user
3. If you're stuck, explain what's blocking you

Avoid excessive exploration - focus on taking action based on what you've learned.

--- file_exists_warning ---
This file content was injected from a user @ reference. The file exists on disk — do not re-read it with read_file unless you need a refreshed copy.

--- json_retry_simple ---
Your response was not valid JSON. Please respond with ONLY a valid JSON object, no markdown, no explanation.

--- json_retry_with_fields ---
Your response was not valid JSON. Please respond with ONLY a valid JSON object containing the required fields. No markdown, no explanation, just the JSON object.

--- init_complete_signal ---
The OPENDEV.md file has been created at {path}. Provide a brief 1-sentence summary confirming what was generated.

--- plan_approved_signal ---
<plan_approved>
Your plan has been approved and {todos_created} todos are ready.

<approved_plan>
{plan_content}
</approved_plan>

Work through the todos in order:
- Mark todo as "doing" (update_todo)
- Implement the step fully — write code, edit files, run commands as needed
- Mark as "done" (complete_todo) only after the implementation is complete
- After ALL todos are done, call task_complete with a brief summary.

Do NOT mark a todo as done without implementing it. Each todo requires actual code changes.
</plan_approved>

--- thinking_analysis_prompt_plan_execution ---
The user's original request: {original_task}

You are executing an approved plan. Analyze the context and provide your reasoning for the next step. Focus on WHAT to implement, not on exploring. Work through the plan steps in order.

--- all_todos_complete_nudge ---
All implementation todos are now complete. Call task_complete with a summary of what was accomplished.

--- docker_command_failed_nudge ---
COMMAND FAILED with exit code {exit_code}. Review the error output above and fix the issue before proceeding. Do not repeat the same command without addressing the root cause.

--- plan_subagent_request ---
User requested planning. Spawn a Planner subagent to plan this task. Include
the task description and this exact plan file path in the prompt: {plan_file_path}
After the Planner returns, call present_plan(plan_file_path="{plan_file_path}").

--- tool_denied_nudge ---
The tool call was denied. Do NOT re-attempt the exact same call. Consider why it was denied and adjust your approach. If unclear, use ask_user to ask the user why the tool call was denied.

--- plan_file_reference ---
A plan file exists from a previous session at {plan_file_path}. You may read
it with read_file and call present_plan to show it for approval, or spawn a
Planner subagent to revise it.

--- explore_first_nudge ---
Before proceeding with this subagent, you should first explore the codebase using Code-Explorer to build context about the relevant code areas. Spawn Code-Explorer first to understand the existing code structure, then re-spawn this subagent with the enriched context.

--- explore_delegate_nudge ---
You have been reading files individually to explore the codebase. For multi-file exploration, you MUST delegate to Code-Explorer instead of reading files one-by-one.

Spawn a Code-Explorer subagent now with a clear question about what you need to understand. Code-Explorer is purpose-built for codebase exploration and will be more thorough and efficient.

--- implicit_completion_nudge ---
Before finishing, verify you have fully addressed the user's complete request:

{original_task}

If there are remaining parts you haven't addressed yet, continue working — use tools to make progress. If everything is truly done, call task_complete with a brief summary of what was accomplished.
