### Introduction

OpenDev is an open-source, terminal-native coding agent built as a compound AI system. Instead of a single monolithic LLM, it uses a structured ensemble of agents and workflows — each independently bound to a user-configured model.

Work is organized into concurrent sessions composed of specialized sub-agents. Each agent executes typed workflows (Execution, Thinking, Compaction) that independently bind to an LLM, enabling fine-grained cost, latency, and capability trade-offs per workflow.

Each workflow is a modular slot you can bind to any LLM of your choice: **Normal** (execution), **Thinking** (reasoning), **Compact** (context summarization), **Self-Critique** (output verification), and **VLM** (vision). For example, use Claude Opus for execution, GPT-o3 for thinking, and a lightweight Qwen model for compaction. Together, these combinations form a compound AI system where multiple models collaborate, each optimized for its role.

OpenDev is currently written in **Python**, with a planned rewrite in **Rust** in the near future.

### Why OpenDev?

- 🤖 **Proactive, not reactive.** OpenDev can plan, execute, and iterate autonomously. Kick off a refactoring, walk away, and come back to a PR ready for review.
- 🔀 **Multi-provider, multi-model.** Assign different models from different providers to every workflow and session, all running in parallel. Your models, your rules.
- 💻 **TUI + Web UI.** A full terminal UI for power users and a Web UI for visual monitoring. The Web UI supports remote sessions, so you can start a task from your phone and let OpenDev work while you sleep. 🛏️📱

### Installation

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv pip install opendev

# With pip
pip install opendev
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Set an API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Fireworks — any one will do)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# export FIREWORKS_API_KEY="fw_..."

# Start the interactive TUI
opendev

# Or start the Web UI
opendev run ui

# Single prompt (non-interactive)
opendev -p "explain this codebase"

# Resume most recent session
opendev --continue
```

Prefer a guided walkthrough? Run `opendev config setup` to interactively choose providers, models, and workflow bindings.

See the [Provider Setup Guide](docs/providers.md) for all 9 supported providers, authentication details, and advanced configuration.

### Multi-Provider Support

OpenDev supports 9 LLM providers: **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Fireworks**, **Google**, **Groq**, **Mistral**, **DeepInfra**, **OpenRouter**, and **Azure OpenAI**.

Each provider's models can be independently assigned to 5 workflow slots:

- **Normal** -- Primary execution model for coding tasks and tool calls
- **Thinking** -- Complex reasoning and planning (falls back to Normal)
- **Compact** -- Context summarization when history grows long (falls back to Normal)
- **Critique** -- Self-critique of agent reasoning (falls back to Thinking)
- **VLM** -- Vision/image processing (falls back to Normal if it supports vision)

Mix and match providers per slot in `~/.opendev/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model_provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "model_thinking_provider": "openai",
  "model_thinking": "o3"
}
```

See the [Provider Setup Guide](docs/providers.md) for the full list of env vars, fallback chains, and configuration options.

### MCP Integration

Dynamic tool discovery via the Model Context Protocol for connecting to external tools and data sources.

```bash
opendev mcp list
opendev mcp add myserver uvx mcp-server-sqlite
opendev mcp enable/disable myserver
```

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendev-to/opendev.git
cd opendev
make install
source .venv/bin/activate
```

A `Makefile` provides shortcuts for all common tasks:

```bash
make check        # Format (Black) + lint (Ruff) + type-check (mypy)
make test         # Run all tests
make test-cov     # Run tests with coverage report
make build-ui     # Build the Web UI frontend
make run          # Start interactive TUI
make run-ui       # Start web UI
make help         # List all available targets
```

### How OpenDev Compares

- **vs. Claude Code / Codex CLI / Gemini CLI:** Closed-source tools that lock you into a single provider. OpenDev is fully open source and lets you mix models from any provider, independently bound per workflow (execution, thinking, critique, compaction, vision).
- **vs. OpenCode:** OpenCode is a great open-source coding agent with TUI, Web UI, and LSP support. However, its architecture is not modular enough to support per-workflow model binding, concurrent multi-agent sessions, or compound AI orchestration.
- **vs. OpenClaw:** OpenDev and OpenClaw share similar concepts around autonomous AI agents. The key difference is focus: OpenDev is purpose-built for the software development lifecycle, with context engineering, structured agent workflows, and deep code understanding.

📋 See the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for what's shipped, in progress, and planned.
